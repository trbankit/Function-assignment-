What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","- > A function is an independent block of code designed to perform a specific task, while a method is a function associated with an object.\n","For example, len() is a function, while list.append() is a method.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","- > Parameters are variables listed inside the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function. Example:\n","\n"," def greet(name):\n","\n"," print('Hello', name) greet('John')\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","- > Functions are defined using the 'def' keyword, and called by their name followed by parentheses. Example:\n","\n"," def add(a, b):\n","\n"," return a + b print(add(2, 3))\n","\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in a Python function?\n","- > The 'return' statement sends a value back to the caller and ends the function's execution. Example: def square(x):\n","\n"," return x * x result = square(4)\n","\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","- > An iterable is a collection of elements (like list, tuple) that can be looped over. An iterator is an object with a __next__() method to get the next element.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","- > Generators are special functions that yield values one by one using 'yield' instead of 'return'. They preserve the state between iterations. Example:\n","\n"," def gen():\n","\n"," yield 1 yield 2\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","- > Generators use less memory, are lazy (produce items one at a time), and improve performance for large data sequences.\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","- > A lambda function is an anonymous, single-expression function. Example: square = lambda x: x * x print(square(5))\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the 'map()' function in Python.\n","- > 'map()' applies a function to all items in an iterable. Example:\n","  nums = [1, 2, 3]\n","  squares = list(map(lambda x: x*x, nums))\n","\n","10. What is the difference between 'map()', 'reduce()', and 'filter()' functions in Python?\n","- > 'map()' transforms all items, 'filter()' selects items based on a condition, 'reduce()' applies a function cumulatively to reduce to a single value.\n","\n","11. Using pen & paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on list [47,11,42,13]\n","- > from functools import reduce\n"," reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [47,11,42,13])\n"," Steps: 47+11=58, 58+42=100, 100+13=113\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Ay0-cG7NgP5Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#practical Questions and answer .\n","1.
